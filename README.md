# The Last Warden

**A 2D survival game built using Allegro.**  
In a hostile world overrun by enemies, you are the last surviving warden. Build defenses, manage resources, and hold your ground as increasingly powerful enemy waves attack from all directions. Strategically place turrets, walls, and traps to survive as long as possible.
